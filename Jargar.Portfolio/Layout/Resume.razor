                    Led migration of Referrals, an integrated workflow system for diamond analysis hardware, from .NET Core 3.1 to .NET 7 while certifying high availability and optimised performance during migration process.
                    Developed Python scripts to execute complex algorithms, contributing to system's analytical capabilities. Partnered closely with cross-functional teams using Scrum and Three Amigos-style planned sessions to align Referrals with diverse needs of stakeholders.
